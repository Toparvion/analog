This file serves as an anchor for resolution of base path to test files in subdirectories.
This became necessary because unit tests can be run on any platform and thus they don't 
know what absolute path would be used at runtime.

Files and directories inside current directory resembles a part of Linux file structure 
in order to model file locations on a typical user system.
